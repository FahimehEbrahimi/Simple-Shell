Compile: gcc -o shell shell.c
Run: ./shell

After running, you will redirect to the implemented shell, started by a welcome text.

Type "help" (without quotation marks): You can see all of the commands that were implemented and tested.
Also, you can see them here.

Note1: Press Ctrl+c or type "exit" to exit
Note2: pressing other shortcuts like "up" and "down" and "tab" keys are not supported. So you need to write your comand completely.


Commands: 
1. Required ones: 
	history
	histat
	pipe like: ls -al | wc
	output redirection like: echo hello > test.txt

2. Additional implemented commands:
	input redirection like: sort < a.txt
	multi-level pipes like: ls | grep te | wc
	cd
	exit
	help
	pwd

3. Some common commands that I have tested:
	mkdir
	ls
	vim
	more
	rm

	cat b.txt
	diff a.txt b.txt
